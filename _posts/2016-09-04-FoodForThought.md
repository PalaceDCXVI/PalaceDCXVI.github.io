A mobile educational game that I made for some folks at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology's Health Sciences department. 

I was responsible for many different features, including gameplay, UI elements, saving and loading and various small programatic details.

The game features several different gameplay modes, one of which I was responsible for is below.

Food items here are collected and stored so that the player can learn more about them and how they fit into a balanced diet.
The items are stored in this log screen:
