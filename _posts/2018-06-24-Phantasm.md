My Game Development Workshop game from my third year at UOIT.

An asymmetrical cooperative survival game made with Unity.

One player is a fairly standard first person shooter, called the agent.

While the other takes on an overseer role, called the hacker, viewing the game through cameras and guiding the agent through dangers and puzzles.

I was responsible for the implementation of the following features within this project:

Gameplay:
  - Agent
    - Basic gameplay controls (movement, shooting)
    - Various UI elements (Compass, ammo)
  - Hacker
    - Basic gameplay controls (UI interaction)
    
Visual Effects:
  - Bloom
  - Temporal anti-aliasing
  
Networking: (entirely my reponsibility)
  - C++ networking dll through winsock2
  - Networking all relevant game data between clients
    - Networking done through a server-client model. No central server, but one of the players is the host.
  - Dead reckoning algorithm for network extrapolation.
