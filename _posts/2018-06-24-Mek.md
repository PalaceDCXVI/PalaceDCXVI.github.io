Game Development Workshop game from my second year at UOIT.

I came on board with this team (Swift Strike Studios) during the second semester of my second year.
During this time, I implemented the following within this game:


Visual Effects:
  - Bloom
  - Screen Space GodRays
  - The static-like effect on the menus.
  
 Artificial Intelligence
  - A-Star pathfinding for Nav-mesh navigation
  
  Gameplay
  - Movement
  - Abilities (Bullet Time)
  - Score system
